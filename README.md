# This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
---- 
## The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
* Type "1" to add a new car
* Type "2" to list the car in the inventory file
* Type "3" to quit the program
---- 
If the user types **"1"**, they will be asked to enter the year, make, and model of the car that they would like to add to the list.
